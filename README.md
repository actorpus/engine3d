# engine3d
simple 3d rendering engine made in python. took about 4h.

uploaded for the purpose of a role in a server :) 

main.py will run with some setups but its made to be a *import-freindly* module.
included some obj files you can make your own with a tool like blender just make sure it exports with ONLY triangulate faces turned on
