# engine3d
simple 3d rendering engine made in python. took about 4h.

uploaded for the purpose of a role in a server :) 

main.py will run with some setups but its made to be a *import-freindly* module.
included some obj files you can make your own with a tool like blender just make sure it exports with ONLY triangulate faces turned on

install instructions;
1) clone or download onto your pc

run instructions;
1) run the main.py file
2) W, A, S, D, UP, DOWN

helpfull testing things;
1) in engine3d.py uncomment line 303 to have the object rotate in space (https://github.com/actorpus/engine3d/blob/ae883febbbb444c0d2234dbec68959ecdbdbcafa/engine3D.py#L303)
2) in main.py the file name for the obj is on line 4
